Memory_map.txt

This is the memory map as used by our test suite:

$2FFC-$2FFD
      Address of the strlen binary (default $3000),
      being passed to strlen_test

$2FFE-$2FFF
      Before entry into strlen_test:
        Pointer to the string (16 bits) is passed in this memory location
      After exit from strlen_test:
        The length of the string (16 bits) is found in this memory location

$3000-$30FF
      strlen machine language object code
      Start address is $3000

$3100-$31FF
      strlen_test machine language object code
      Start address is $3100

$3200-$32FF
      The string to be tested is placed here by the BASIC program
      Start address is $3200

Therefore, this test suite will only work in its unmodified form with Cocos
that have at least 16K RAM.  You can modify it to work with 4K Cocos.
