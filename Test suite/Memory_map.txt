Memory map.txt
by Richard John Foster Cavell (c) 2017

This is the memory map as used by our test suite:

$2FFC-$2FFD (PA)
      Address of the strlen binary (default $3000),
      being passed to the helper1 routine

$2FFE-$2FFF (PB)
      Before entry into helper1:
        Pointer to the string (16 bits) is passed in this memory location
      After exit from helper1:
        The length of the string (16 bits) is found in this memory location

$3000-$30FF (PM)
      strlen machine language object code
      Start address is $3000

$3100-$3170 (PN)
      helper1 machine language object code
      Start address is $3100

$317C-$317D (PP)
      Length of the string that shall be constructed, being passed to helper2

$317E-$317F (PQ)
      Address where the constructed string will start

$3180 (PR)
      helper2 machine language object code
      Start address is $3180

$3200-$3FFF (PS)
      The string to be tested is placed here either by:
        the TEST program, which is written in BASIC, OR
        the helper2 program, which is written in assembly
      Start address is $3200
