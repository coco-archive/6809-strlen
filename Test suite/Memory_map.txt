Memory map.txt

This is the memory map as used by our test suite:

$3000-$307F
      main1.s (strlen) machine language object code
      Start address is $3000

$3080-$30FF
      main2.s (no_error_strlen) machine language object code
      Start address is $3080

$3100-$317F (USR1)
      helper1 machine language object code
      Start address is $3100

$3180-$31FF (USR2)
      helper2 machine language object code
      Start address is $3180

$3200-$3FFF (PS)
      The string to be tested is placed here either by:
        the TEST program, which is written in BASIC, OR
        the helper2 program, which is written in assembly
      Start address is $3200
