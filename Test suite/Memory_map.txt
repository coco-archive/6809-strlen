Memory map.txt
by Richard John Foster Cavell (c) 2017

This is the memory map as used by our test suite:

$2FFC-$2FFD
      Address of the strlen binary (default $3000),
      being passed to the helper routine

$2FFE-$2FFF
      Before entry into helper:
        Pointer to the string (16 bits) is passed in this memory location
      After exit from helper:
        The length of the string (16 bits) is found in this memory location

$3000-$30FF
      strlen machine language object code
      Start address is $3000

$3100-$31FF
      helper machine language object code
      Start address is $3100

$3200-$3FFF
      The string to be tested is placed here by the TEST program,
      which is written in BASIC
      Start address is $3200

This test suite will only work in its unmodified form with Cocos
that have at least 16K RAM and a disk drive, with Disk Extended
Color BASIC.
