Part of the 6809-strlen Test suite
(c) 2017 Richard Cavell

This test suite has been successfully tested with, and is only officially
supported in regard to, the following emulated machines:

$ xroar -machine coco2b

  (with bas13.rom, extbas11.rom and disk11.rom in the ~/.xroar/roms directory)

  There are annoying bugs with prior versions of Color BASIC and
  Extended Color BASIC. I suggest that you don't use them.

$ mame coco2b

  (with coco2b.zip in ~/.mame/roms)

It probably works with other machines as well, but I do not desire to
provide official support to other configurations.
