Here is how you use the test suite:

1. You need a UNIX-like operating system.  I use Ubuntu 16.04.
2. Install asm6809, make, and MAME.
   I find that the very latest version of MAME works significantly better
   in emulating the Coco than the one that comes with Ubuntu 16.04.
3. Install the Coco ROMS for MAME's use.
4. Build the binary files by going to the 6809-strlen directory and typing
   "make", then going to the "Test suite" directory and typing "make".
5. Start a MAME session with debugger with the following command:
   mame coco2b -debug
6. In the debug window, type:
   load strlen.bin, 3000, 0
7  load strlen_test.bin, 3100, 0
8. Load STRLEN.BAS into the MAME Coco.
   I haven't figured out how to do this yet.
