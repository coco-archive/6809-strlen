1. Modify strlen to search for the character "Q" instead of the end of
   the string.

   You will need to decide what happens if there is no "Q" in the string
   being tested.

2. Modify strlen so that it skips over blank spaces without counting them.

3. The ASCII code for backspace is 8. Have the strlen routine correctly
   reduce the length count when it encounters backspace characters.

   Be careful not to let the length drop below zero.

4. Modify strlen to change every character of the string to uppercase
   while it reads the string.

5. In most 6809-based systems, the IRQ vectors are placed in locations
   $FFFx, so it is difficult or impossible to store a string in those
   locations.  Adjust strlen.s so that it returns "no end" before it gets
   to the IRQ vectors.

I hope that you enjoy programming!
