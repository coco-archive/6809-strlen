Part of 6809-strlen by Richard Cavell (c) 2017, 2018

1. Modify strlen.s to change every character of the string to uppercase
   while it reads the string.

2. Modify strlen.s to search for the character "Q" in the string, and
   return its distance from the start of the string.

   You will need to modify lines 1300 to 1450 of the test suite to ensure
   that there is a "Q" in every test string.

3. Change the calling convention for the strlen.s and no_error_strlen.s
   routines to something that you think is more suitable.

   Then amend the test suite to correctly test your new code.

4. Modify the test suite to profile the assembly portion (ie time how long it
   takes) and print a comparison between the BASIC and assembly method, in
   terms of their speed.

5. Write an additional assembly routine that copies a string from one memory
   location to another, and call it 6809-strcpy.  Add code to the test suite
   to prove that it works with all of the strings.

   The test suite might only be able to test this new routine with a computer
   that has 64K of RAM.  Why?

I hope that you enjoy programming!
