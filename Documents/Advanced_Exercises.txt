1. Modify strlen.s to change every character of the string to uppercase
   while it reads the string.

2. Modify strlen.s to search for the character "Q" instead of the end of
   the string.

   You will need to decide what happens if there is no "Q" in the string
   being tested.

3. Change the calling convention for the strlen and no_error_strlen
   routines to something that you think is more suitable.

   Then amend the test suite to correctly test your new code.

4. Modify the test suite to profile the assembly portion (ie time how long it
   takes) and print a comparison between the BASIC and assembly method, in
   terms of their speed.

   Note that the version of BASIC provided with the Color Computer provides
   a variable called TIMER, which increments every one-sixtieth of a second.

5. Write an additional assembly routine that copies a string from one memory
   location to another, and call it 6809-strcpy.  Add code to the test suite
   to prove that it works with all of the strings.

   The test suite might have difficulty fully testing this new routine with
   all of the test strings, on a machine that has only 32K of RAM.  Why?

I hope that you enjoy programming!
