1.  Translate the test suite into your favourite language, and remove
    unwanted languages.

2.  Modify strlen so that it skips over blank spaces without counting them.

3.  Modify strlen to change every character of the string to uppercase
    while it reads the string.

4.  Reorder the instructions so that _strlen_normal_finish immediately
    follows _strlen_loop_end, and the error handler routine is below the
    normal exit point.

    Be careful to modify the assembly instructions so that the program
    flows to the correct place in each case.

5.  Change the memory map so that the machine language routines and the
    string to be tested start at $6100 instead of $6000.

    Remember to change the test suite as well.

I hope that you enjoy programming!
