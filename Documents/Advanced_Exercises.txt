1.  Modify strlen to search for the character "Q" instead of the end of
    the string.

    You will need to decide what happens if there is no "Q" in the string
    being tested.

2.  Modify strlen so that it skips over blank spaces without counting them.

3.  The ASCII code for backspace is 8. Have the strlen routine correctly
    reduce the length count when it encounters backspace characters.

    Be careful not to let the length drop below zero.

4.  Have strlen delete characters as it reads them, for security purposes

5.  Modify strlen to change every character of the string to uppercase
    while it reads the string.

I hope that you enjoy programming!
