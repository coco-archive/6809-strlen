Once you have fully understood the project, including the test suite,
the aspiring programmer is invited to try the following exercises:

1. Modify either strlen.s or no_error_strlen.s to give an incorrect result,
   and demonstrate this with the test suite.

2. Modify strlen.s to change every character of the string to uppercase
   while it reads the string.

   Under what circumstances will this code fail?

3. Change the calling convention for the strlen.s and no_error_strlen.s
   routines to something that you think is more suitable.

   Then amend the test suite to correctly test your new code.

4. Modify the test suite to profile the assembly portion (ie time how long it
   takes) and print a comparison between the BASIC and assembly method, in
   terms of their speed.

5. Demonstrate that the BASIC portion of the routine might fail if the
   string is not placed in a suitable portion of the memory map.

I hope you enjoy tinkering!
