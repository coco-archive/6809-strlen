For the beginner, I suggest learning about strlen.s by doing the following:

1.  Change strlen.s so that it uses register B instead of A to test for
    the terminating zero.

2.  Change strlen.s so that it uses register Y instead of X as the pointer
    variable.

3.  Change the PSHS X instruction into a different instruction which has the
    same effect.

4.  Change the PULS X,PC instruction into PULS X and then add another
    instruction which has the same effect as PULS PC.

5.  Modify either strlen.s or no_error_strlen.s to give an incorrect result,
    and demonstrate this with the test suite.

For all exercises, use the test suite to prove that the new code works
perfectly.

I hope that you enjoy learning!
