Once you have understood the basics of the project, including the test suite,
the aspiring programmer is invited to try the following exercises:

1.  Reorder the instructions so that _strlen_normal_finish immediately
    follows _strlen_loop_end, and the error handler routine is below the
    normal exit point.

    Be careful to modify the assembly instructions so that the program
    flows to the correct place in each case.

2.  Use line 900 of the test suite program to simulate errors in the
    assembly language routines.  Make sure that you understand what is
    being tested for, and how the test might fail.

3.  Change the memory map so that the machine language routines and the
    string to be tested start at $6100 instead of $6000.

    Remember to change the test suite as well.

4.  Demonstrate that the BASIC portion of the project might fail if the
    string is placed in an unsuitable portion of the memory map.

5.  In most 6809-based systems, the IRQ vectors are placed in locations
    $FFFx, so it is difficult or impossible to store a string in those
    locations.  Adjust strlen.s so that it returns "no end" before it gets
    to the IRQ vectors.

I hope that you enjoy tinkering!
