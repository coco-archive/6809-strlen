Once you have understood the basics of the project, including the test suite,
the aspiring programmer is invited to try the following exercises:

1.  Use line 900 of the test suite program to simulate errors in the
    assembly language routines.  Make sure that you understand what is
    being tested for, and how the test might fail.

2.  Modify strlen to search for the character "Q" instead of the end of
    the string.

    You will need to decide what happens if there is no "Q" in the string
    being tested.

3.  Demonstrate that the BASIC portion of the project might fail if the
    string is placed in an unsuitable portion of the memory map.

4.  Have strlen delete characters as it reads them, for security purposes.

5.  In most 6809-based systems, the IRQ vectors are placed in locations
    $FFFx, so it is difficult or impossible to store a string in those
    locations.  Adjust strlen.s so that it returns "no end" before it gets
    to the IRQ vectors.

I hope that you enjoy tinkering!
