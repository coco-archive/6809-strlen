Once you have understood the basics of the project, including the test suite,
the aspiring programmer is invited to try the following exercises:

1.  Modify either strlen.s or no_error_strlen.s to give an incorrect result,
    and demonstrate this with the test suite.

2.  Use line 820 of the test suite program to simulate errors in the
    assembly language routines.  Make sure that you understand what is
    being tested for, and how the test might fail.

3.  Change the memory map so that the machine language routines and the
    string to be tested start at $6100 instead of $6000.

    Remember to change the test suite as well.

4.  Demonstrate that the BASIC portion of the project might fail if the
    string is placed in an unsuitable portion of the memory map.

5.  Translate the test suite into your favourite language other than English.

I hope that you enjoy tinkering!
