Once you have understood the basics of the project, including the test suite,
the aspiring programmer is invited to try the following exercises:

1.  Use line 800 of the test suite to change the default language of the
    test suite.

2.  Translate the test suite into your favourite language, or remove
    unwanted languages.

3.  Determine the default language for the test suite by placing a text
    file on the test suite disk, which consists of a single letter: E, D,
    F, or S.  Replace line 800 of TEST.BAS with a routine that reads this
    file to choose the default language.

4.  Use line 900 of the test suite program to simulate errors in the
    assembly language routines.  Make sure that you understand what is
    being tested for, and how the test might fail.

5.  Demonstrate that the BASIC portion of the project might fail if the
    string is placed in an unsuitable portion of the memory map.

I hope that you enjoy learning more!
