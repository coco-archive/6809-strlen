Once you have understood the basics of the assembly language portion of the
project, you are invited to try the following exercises:

1.  Use line 800 of the test suite to change the default language of the
    test suite.

2.  Place a text file on the test suite disk, which indicates the default
    language for the text suite.  Replace line 800 of TEST.BAS with a
    routine that reads this file to determine the default language.

3.  Use line 900 of the test suite program to simulate errors in the
    assembly language routines.  Make sure that you understand what is
    being tested for, and how the test might fail.

4.  Add sound to the test suite.

5.  Demonstrate that the BASIC portion of the project might fail if the
    string is placed in an unsuitable portion of the memory map.

I hope that you enjoy learning more!
