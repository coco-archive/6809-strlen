4. Why are time-critical subroutines placed at the start of the program ?

5. Why aren't the very long strings for test 7 and test 8 stored in a BASIC
   string variable ?

7. What is the point of multiplying EA by 256 in line 45100 ?

8. Look at the subroutine that starts at line 20000. Is it a good thing to
