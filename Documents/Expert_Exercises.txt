1. Modify the test suite to profile the assembly portion (ie time how long it
   takes) and print a comparison between the BASIC and assembly method, in
   terms of their speed.

   Note that the version of BASIC provided with the Color Computer provides
   a variable called TIMER, which increments either every one-fiftieth or
   every one-sixtieth of a second.  Write a program to test how fast
   TIMER increments on your machine.

2. Use an ASCII chart or write a BASIC program, and identify which character
   codes are non-printing (ie they do not produce an identifiable glyph on
   the screen).

   Modify strlen so that it does not count these.

3. Change the calling convention for the strlen and no_error_strlen
   routines to pass the address of the string to be searched on the
   system stack.

4. Write a routine that searches a string for a particular character, and
   returns a pointer to it, or $0000 if the character does not exist in
   the string.

   You will need to establish a calling convention - a way of passing both
   the pointer to the string to be searched, and the character to search for,
   to the routine.  Make sure the test suite and helper1 routine can achieve
   this.

5. Write a routine that searches a given string for the text "SENTINEL"

And bonus exercise:

   Write an additional assembly routine that copies a string from one memory
   location to another, and call it 6809-strcpy.  Add code to the test suite
   to prove that it works with all of the strings.

I hope that you enjoy programming!
