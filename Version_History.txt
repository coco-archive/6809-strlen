(c) 2017, 2018, 2019 by Richard Cavell

Version 1.6 (6 November 2018)

  * Many more exercises have been added to the Documents folder

      * The exercises are now called "Level_One.txt" to "Level_Seven.txt"
      * Exercises have been shuffled and are roughly grouped by difficulty
        and theme

  * All assembly source files now export their symbols

  * The makefiles now have many more targets, and can produce listings
    and symbols

  * The test suite can now handle a no-end error without halting

  * The test suite program is now significantly smaller (simply by removing
    spaces, using multiple statements on one line, etc)

Version 1.5 (19 October 2018)

  * New documents:

      * Assembly_Questions.txt
      * BASIC_Program.txt
      * BASIC_Questions.txt
      * Book_Recommendations.txt
      * Intermediate_Exercises.txt

      There is now much more material, and material for a wider range of
      skill levels.

  * Simulation of error conditions is now performed within helper1.s

  * The test suite can handle a no-end error condition without halting
    execution.

  * Numerous other minor changes to source code and documentation

Version 1.4 (7 January 2018)

  * This is the final version of 6809-strlen (probably)

    The original specification and mission are fulfilled.

  * Addition of two new files:

      * Beginner_exercises.txt
      * Advanced_exercises.txt

    All of the ideas that I have ever had that would improve this project
    have now been implemented. I cannot think of any modification that would
    clearly improve the project any further.

    I have had a number of ideas over my time developing this project, where
    I'm not sure that implementing them would improve the project. Sometimes
    it feels as though I am just fiddling with it instead of improving it.

    I have taken all of my remaining ideas and given them to you, the student,
    as training exercises. You can decide whether their implementation would
    improve the project.

Version 1.3 (23 November 2017)

  * The test suite has been improved

      * Translation into German, French and Spanish
      * Now requires 32K minimum RAM
      * Now always measures the length of the string
        manually using BASIC
      * Can simulate errors to assist with testing
      * Less code duplication
      * Automation of testing using XRoar and MAME:

        * make xroar
        * make mame

  * Tiny cosmetic changes to the non-test suite portions of the
    project

  * New file:

      * Symbols.inc

        This allows for calculation of the memory map by the assembler
        and ensuring that the object code fits within the allocated space

  * Removal of file:

      * Memory_map.txt

Version 1.2 (1 November 2017)

  * The routine now comes in two versions:

      * strlen.s
      * no_error_strlen.s

      * strlen.s now identifies the "no end" error, which occurs when the
        string is read up to memory location $FFFF without finding a
        terminating zero
      * no_error_strlen.s is for when you are sure that this error
        will not be encountered

      * Both versions are, and will be, actively maintained
      * The test suite now tests both versions
      * The object code assembles with asm6809 into:

          * strlen.bin - 15 bytes
          * no_error_strlen.bin - 21 bytes

  * The code has been improved

      * Slight savings in speed have been achieved
      * The CODE pseudo-op is used at the start of the code
      * All symbols that might be useful are now exported
      * The object code length is calculated and exported
      * We now use 4-space indents

  * The test suite has been improved

      * We now use the decb utility from the Toolshed
        (https://sourceforge.net/projects/toolshed/) to automatically
        build the test suite disk, making things much easier
      * The test suite now builds its own versions of strlen.bin and
        no_error_strlen.bin, as DECB executable files rather than raw binaries
        (DECB means Disk Extended Color BASIC)
      * You can now build the test suite and run XRoar or MAME from a single
        make command
      * helper1.bin now takes a parameter, to indicate which routine you
        want to use
      * And more!

  * Removal of certain files in the "Test suite" folder:

      * Machines.txt
      * Technical_info.txt

      Their contents are now incorporated into the test suite
      Readme.txt

Version 1.1 (24 August 2017)

  * Slight improvements to strlen.s

      * Add label _strlen_entry, which identifies the entry point
      * Slight modification to the code, for maximum portability
        to other assemblers
          * PULS X, PC -> PULS X,PC  (removal of space)
      * Removal of the ORG command, for maximum portability to other
        projects
      * To assemble a standalone routine or to incorporate it into the
        test suite, you should now use main.s, which includes the ORG
        command and what remains of strlen.s
      * And more!

  * Improved code comments and Readme.txt

      The following things are now explicitly documented:

      * What a C-style string is
      * The routine is position-independent and re-entrant
      * Interrupts are allowed to occur during execution
      * 2 extra bytes of the S stack are being used

  * Creation of new files

      * Machines.txt         (in the Test Suite folder)
      * Version_history.txt  (in the main folder)

  * Many significant improvements to the test suite

      * TEST.BAS now calls the machine language routines using USRx()
        instead of EXEC, so parameters are handled more neatly
      * helper1.s and helper2.s now use the DECB (Disk Extended Color BASIC)
        calling conventions
      * The memory map has been greatly simplified
      * helper2.s now constructs the test string 2 bytes at a time, so
        it is faster. It will still correctly handle odd lengths
      * Both assembly files have been modified for maximum portability
        to other assemblers
          * Characters are now presented as 'A rather than 'A'
          * Two chars are now presented as 'A * 256 + 'B  rather than "AB"
      * All magic numbers are now presented as symbols
      * And more!

  * We are now supporting only two platforms for the test suite

      * Machines.txt identifies those targets. Both are emulated machines:

          * xroar coco2b
          * mame coco2b

      * The ability of TEST.BAS to work from tape has been removed

Version 1.0 (28 July 2017)

    * Initial stable release of 6809-strlen
