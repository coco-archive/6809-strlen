Part of 6809-strlen by Richard Cavell (c) 2017
https://github.com/richardcavell/6809-strlen

For the beginner, I suggest learning about the project by doing the following:

1.  Change strlen.s so that it uses register B instead of A to test for
    the terminating zero.

2.  Change the result that is returned in the event of a "no end" error.

    Remember to change the test suite if you want it to correctly interface
    with your modification.

3.  Use line 820 of the test suite program to simulate errors in the
    assembly language routines.  Make sure that you understand what is
    being tested for, and how it might fail.

4.  Change the memory map so that the machine language routines and the
    string to be tested start at 0x5000 instead of 0x6000.

    Remember to change the test suite as well.

5.  Translate the test suite into your favourite language.

I hope that you enjoy learning!
