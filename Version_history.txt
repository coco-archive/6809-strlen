6809-strlen Version_history.txt
(c) 2017 by Richard Cavell

Version 1.1 (24 August 2017)

  * Slight improvements to strlen.s

      * Add label _strlen_entry, which identifies the entry point
      * Slight modification to the code, for maximum portability
        to other assemblers
          * PULS X, PC -> PULS X,PC  (removal of space)
      * Removal of the ORG command, for maximum portability to other
        projects
      * To assemble a standalone routine or to incorporate it into the
        test suite, you should now use main.s, which includes the ORG
        command and what remains of strlen.s
      * And more!

  * Many significant improvements to the test suite

      * TEST.BAS now calls the machine language routines using USRx()
        instead of EXEC, so parameters are handled more neatly
      * Memory map has been greatly simplified
      * helper1.s and helper2.s now use the DECB (Disk Extended Color BASIC)
        calling conventions
      * helper2.s now constructs the test string 2 bytes at a time, so
        it is faster. It will still correctly handle odd lengths
      * Both assembly files have been modified for maximum portability
        to other assemblers
          * Characters are now presented as 'A rather than 'A'
          * Strings are now presented as 'A * 256 + 'B  rather than "AB"
      * All magic numbers are now presented as symbols
      * And more!

  * We are now supporting only two platforms for the test suite

      * Machines.txt identifies those targets. Both are emulated machines:

          * xroar coco2b, and
          * mame coco2b

      * The ability of TEST.BAS to work from tape has been removed

  * Improved code comments and Readme.txt

      The following things are now explicitly documented:

      * The routine is position-independent and re-entrant
      * Interrupts are allowed to occur during execution
      * 2 extra bytes of the S stack are being used
      * What a C-style string is

  * Creation of new files

      * Machines.txt         (in the Test Suite folder)
      * Version_history.txt  (in the main folder)

Version 1.0 (28 July 2017)

    * Initial stable release of 6809-strlen
